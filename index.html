Dear my honey panda,<br><br>

For this anniversary, I wanted to focus on places. The places that we've been to as a couple have special meaning. To give scope, I focused only on the places we were together before having the two babies. For simplicity, this is from the time we first met in Florham Park to the birth of our first child in Riverview Medical Center. I didn't include the date or time because I'm not that smart. <br><br>I have pictures from Google Maps because I want us to relive these very important moments in our lives, building our relationship, by putting us back there visually. Just a word of caution: my sources for this information was the external hard drive where we store our pictures, my Facebook albums and my memory. The most flawed source is my memory. Things in this might be innaccurate. Please don't yell at me.
<br><br>
Love,
The Mongey

	jQuery is a common JavaScript library for reading and making changes to the
	Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree that contains information
	about what is actually visible on a website.

	While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the
	DOM and the DOM can change. In fact, JavaScript's power comes from
	its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JavaScript
	object. When JavaScript makes something interesting happen on a
	website, it's likely the action happened because JavaScript changed
	the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but it doesn't do anything
	you can't accomplish with vanilla (regular) JavaScript.
